# Changelog

## 2.11.1

- **Fix: subpath types no longer silently degrade to `any`.** 2.11.0 shipped
  13 of the 16 d.ts files (all but `flow`, `llm` and the root) re-exporting
  their types from relative paths (`from './parser/spec-parser.js'`) that never
  shipped — under `skipLibCheck` (every consumer) the imports don't error, the
  types just turn to `any`. Cause: the private domain packages' `build:types`
  step (`tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --noEmit false`) overwrote tsup's bundled
  `index.d.ts` with a per-module tsc tree the aggregate's dts `resolve` can't
  follow. All domain packages now emit a single bundled, self-contained d.ts
  (`bdd`/`jsx`/`todo` gained `dts: true`; `sprites` bundles dts from its index
  entry only), and the tree-emitting override is gone.
- Declare `@lokascript/intent` as a dependency: `flow`'s d.ts imports its types
  at the top level, and an undeclared transitive dep is unresolvable for types
  under pnpm's isolated layout (same silent-`any` failure mode).
- New guards so this class can't ship again: a `dts-integrity` vitest suite and
  a d.ts self-containment check in `scripts/pack-smoke.sh` — every published
  declaration file must contain no `@lokascript/domain-*` names, no relative
  imports whose target doesn't ship, and no bare imports outside declared
  dependencies.

## 2.11.0

- First release of the consolidated `@lokascript/domains` aggregate: one published
  package with per-domain subpath exports (`@lokascript/domains/sql`, `/flow`,
  `/bdd`, …). Supersedes the individual `@lokascript/domain-*` packages, which
  are deprecated in favor of this one. The root entry absorbs
  `@lokascript/domain-config` (registry wiring, `DOMAIN_PRIORITY`, language sets)
  and adds `registerAllDomains(registry)` for callers that need to await schema
  attachment.
